            <h3>Rokko Tuah: Berlin’s Emerging Street Artist</h3>
            <p>
                Rokko Tuah is a Berlin-based street artist who began his journey into street art only three months ago.  
                His work, often found in overlooked corners of Berlin, reflects raw emotions and themes of solitude, urban disconnection, and identity.  
                Remaining entirely anonymous, Tuah’s experimental murals combine abstract forms with muted tones,  
                capturing the hidden beauty of neglected urban spaces. While largely unknown, his growing presence in the local art scene has sparked curiosity among street art enthusiasts.

            <p>
                Tuah’s pieces, scattered across districts like Neukölln and Wedding, often go unsigned, adding to the mystery surrounding his identity.  
                His art stands as a quiet reminder of the stories told in Berlin’s hidden spaces, making him a unique voice in the city’s ever-evolving street art culture.
